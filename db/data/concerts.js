  title: 'Valentines\' Brunch',
  performer1: 'Alex Knox (Actor)',
  performer2: 'Eleanor Janes (Soprano)',
  performer3: 'Olivia Jageurs (Harp)',
  description: 'Bring a date or just a mate and we will serenade the soul while you chomp down your avocado toast. Opera singer Eleanor Janes will be singing well-loved love songs in the classical canon, accompanied by the most romantic instrument of all: the harp. And actor Alex Knox will be there to melt even the coldest heart with some classic (and brand new) poetry. This was possibly the most fun brunch last year, because just like our classical music, we don\'t take Valentine\'s day too seriously. '
